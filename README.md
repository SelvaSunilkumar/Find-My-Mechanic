# Find My Mechanic

Find my Mechanic is an Web application, developed intentionally for the mechanics to get job and get their actual pay for the work and also to avoid a third party involvement. Also this focuses on direct converstation with mechanic, which will make User more satisfactory.

The idea is to find and complete the House problems on a single click.

Here, we have two modules, namely
1. User (House Owner and Tenant)
2. Mechanic (Plumber, Painter, Electrician...)

#### User (House Owners/Tenants)

* On login, users will be displayed with a list of mechanics situated around 100km radius around them.
* Users can filter the mechanics based on the default location filter provided
* Users are always encouraged to go through the mechanic performance and average salary.
* Therefore, Users can choose a mechanic as per their choice.
* And on sending request to mechanic, it would ask for
* * Work Date
* * Purpose of Work
* Once the details are provided, a request is send to mechanic. The invitation is also send to mechanics mail Id.
